# Classifier 

The classifier was implemented using Keras, with the aid of Jupyter Notebook. 
[This](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification) dataset was taken from Kaggle and adapted to the scope of the project, as some 1\textsuperscript{st} Pok√©mons were missing.

In particular, there are around 25 to 50 images for each Pokemon, all with the Pokemon in the centre. Most (if not all) images have relatively high quality (correct labels, centred).
