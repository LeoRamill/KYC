# GUI

The GUI was implemented using Tkinter, a library in the standard Python toolkit, and Pillow. This was made in order to make the experience more user-friendly. 
When starting, the user is prompted to select the expansion between Base, Fossil and Jungle, afterwards, the snapped picture of the card is displayed along with marks in pure BGS style and all the card's info. The GUI takes the Pok√©mon's type as color palette, as seen below.
